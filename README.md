# Proverbial_Wallet
The Proverbial Wallet is a project based partially on analysis of human emotions and partially on human computer interaction. A wallet with tactile feedback.


Here's Some more information about this project.


THE HISTORY:

In today’s world, in the 21st century, technology has crossed its limits. Whether it may be the field of transportation, communication, research or in that case even transaction of money.

Technology has taken a huge leap in every field. In today’s time, right from the most complicated technologies to the simplest of the simplest ideas are involved to make human life easy.

To make human life easy one of the key aspect is using HUMAN GESTURES.

HUMAN GESTURES:

Human gesture is a non-verbal type of communication, in which one person communicates with other with the help of his body language, Example: Waving hands in order to say Goodbye, smiling when happy and as a matter of fact even crying when hurt emotionally is a gesture.

These gestures are ALSO USED in the field of technology;

For Example:

Swiping the touch screen of mobile in order to scroll.
Simulators like flight simulators and railway simulators.
Smile detectors in cameras.
Now we come to the main part of this project The PROVERBIAL WALLET.

PROVERBIAL WALLET

THE IDEA:

Proverbial wallet is based on the basic concept of Human Gestures. In today’s world due to advanced money transaction technology it is possible to buy any product around the globe on the press of a button and transfer a huge amount of money.

This technology has its own pros and cons.

One of the cons of this technology is people don’t get the feeling that a huge amount has been transferred from their account and this is where we introduce the PROVERBIAL WALLET.

The basic idea behind PROVERBIAL WALLET is to make people understand the sanctity of their money transaction better.

WHAT IT DOES:

Proverbial wallet is linked to your bank account, it has access to the balance of your account via the internet.

Proverbial wallet is developed in 3 major leaps

LEAP 1:  Vibration

IDEA:                                                                                              

The idea behind this is that the wallet will vibrate if a transaction is made. A vibrator will be installed inside the wallet. It will vibrate in a particular pattern if a deposit is made and in another pattern if a withdrawal is made. Plus the magnitude of vibration will be directly proportional to the amount of transaction, more the money involved in the transaction, more vigorous and prolonged will be the vibrations in the wallet.

HOW WILL IT HELP:

Whenever cash is withdrawn a vibration will be felt. Now this will be remembered in the human mind over a period of time. Every time his wallet will vibrate he will understand that money is removed or deducted from his account. Nobody likes money getting reduced from their account. And as the vibration of the wallet is associated with withdrawal of cash, the human brain will start treating it as an emotional pain. Hence if a person goes to buy a product say suppose a pair of shoes, which the person really doesn’t require, one of the reasons why he will be discouraged to buy the shoes is that his brain will be facing the emotional pain of the vibrating wallet. Now this pain will not arise if he buys something which he really wants, because when he is sure he really requires it, such emotions will not arise, and hence this will SAVE MONEY.

LEAP 2: Resistance
IDEA:

The basic idea behind this is it will be difficult to open the wallet if you have less money in your account. This will be achieved by using electromagnets. If the wallet detects there is less money in your account it will automatically increase the current in the electromagnets and it will be difficult to open the wallet.

HOW WILL IT HELP:

Consider a practical example: Suppose I go to a shopping mall and I see a burger stall, now I am not really hungry, but because I have a Debit Card I just go there order a burger and swipe my card. But if I had a Proverbial Wallet, just the thought that I would have to use all my force to open the wallet, will make me reluctant, it will discourage me from making unnecessary transactions, and hence SAVE MONEY.

LEAP 3: Inflation

IDEA:

The basic idea involved is that the wallet will inflate (Swell) when the balance in your account is high and will deflate if the balance in your account is low. This is based on the concept of that more the money you have, more of it will get stuffed inside wallet and the size (Thickness) of wallet will increase, similarly if there is more money in your bank account the wallet will automatically pump air in your wallet depending on how high or low is your bank balance is.

HOW WILL IT HELP:

Contrary to the previous ideas this concept of inflating wallets will not discourage the person from buying stuff, it will in fact give him confidence and encourage him to spend. Even if the person will have no cash in his wallet, just because he has a huge bank account it will inflate his wallet and give him the feeling that he is high on cash.

CONCLUSION:

PROVERBIAL WALLET is a way for the bank account to communicate with the account holder. It brings emotions and feelings into the scene. It is not just an electronic wallet, it is way to make transactions smarter and with complete presence of mind.

INSPIRED BY THE PROVERB:      Penny Wise Pound Foolish.

Technology Used

The technology used can be classified into four major aspects.

The Mobile Technology
The Vibrational Technology
The Resistance Technology
The Inflation Technology
This can be better understood with the help of chart below.

ASPECT 1: The mobile technology:

   The Bluetooth Module

This is the most important and most complicated amongst all the other technologies. Its purpose will be to retrieve the information of the client’s bank account balance, the deposits and the withdrawals. It will access the internet retrieve the required data and send it to the wallet in the manner in which it will understand.

The retrieving of data will be done with the help of a 2G or a 3G connection provided in the mobile, this data will further be sent to the device in the manner in which they will understand.

The communication between the mobile and the wallet devices will be done with the help of Bluetooth technology.

This process has to be both fast and secured. Neither the speed nor the security can be compromised as we are dealing with the bank account of the client.

ASPECT 2: Vibration        

This is an electronic vibrating device, it will further include two handlings.

The Pattern of vibration.
The Magnitude of vibration.
The pattern of vibration will depend upon whether it’s a deposit or a withdrawal taking place.

The magnitude of vibration will depend upon the amount of cash involved in transaction, where the magnitude of vibration is directly proportional to the amount of cash.

ASPECT 3: Resistance 

This will involve an electromagnet with variable magnetism. This electromagnet will be controlled by a Bluetooth device which will communicate with the mobile. If the account balance is low it will increase the magnetism thus making it difficult to open your wallet.

ASPECT 4: Inflation

Underneath the outer skin of the wallet will lie a rubber air tight bag connected to a mini air pump. The pump will be connected to the Bluetooth device to communicate with the mobile. There will also be an electronic exhaust valve which will control the amount of outlet air. This will keep the pressure inside the chamber desirable.

The Wallet is designed using Arduino Nano with Atmega 328 microcontroller
